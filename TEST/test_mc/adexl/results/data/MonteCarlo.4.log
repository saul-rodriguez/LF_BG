Monte Carlo Sampling yield summary:
Number of spec values are in this yield data: 1
MC_test	Nominal - 
	VTH:	Yield	100%
		Min 0.561131	Max 0.60137	Mean 0.58031	Number of errors 0

MC_test
	Overall Yield	100%	Number of points passed	20	Total number of points	20

Estimated yield = 100% (20/20), 0 errors
Estimated yield (No opregions) = 100% (20/20)
