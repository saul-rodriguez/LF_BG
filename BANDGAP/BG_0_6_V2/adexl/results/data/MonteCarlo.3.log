Monte Carlo Sampling yield summary:
Number of spec values are in this yield data: 1
MC	Nominal - 
	VDC("/VREF"):	Yield	100%
		Min 0.597342	Max 0.607666	Mean 0.602278	Number of errors 0

MC
	Overall Yield	100%	Number of points passed	4	Total number of points	4

Estimated yield = 100% (4/4), 0 errors
Estimated yield (No opregions) = 100% (4/4)
