Monte Carlo Sampling yield summary:
Number of spec values are in this yield data: 1
MC	Nominal - 
	VDC("/VREF"):	Yield	100%
		Min 0.580424	Max 0.611577	Mean 0.599618	Number of errors 0

MC
	Overall Yield	100%	Number of points passed	100	Total number of points	100

Estimated yield = 100% (100/100), 0 errors
Estimated yield (No opregions) = 100% (100/100)
